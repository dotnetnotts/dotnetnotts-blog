### Have a blog idea?

If you have an idea for the .NET Notts blog, but don't necessarily want to write it, how about raising a Blog Topic Request? The themes of this blog page are around:

- The .NET Notts Meetup
- Anything about the .NET Ecosystem

Think there is something missing? Raise an issue to let us know/so that we have a pool of ideas for people who want to write.

- Create a feature branch with a name like: `post/short-description-of-topic`
- Under the _posts folder create a markdown file with a title that follows this pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title-post.md`
- Write your post in markdown.
- Raise a pull request and assign `wordshaker` (Jessica) and `pjgpetecodes` (Pete) as reviewers
- _(We may need an extra nudge on Slack or Twitter to know your PR is there)_
