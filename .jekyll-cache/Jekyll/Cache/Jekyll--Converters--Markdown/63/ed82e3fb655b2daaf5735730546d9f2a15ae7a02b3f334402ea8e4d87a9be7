<h1 id="what-contributions-you-could-make">What contributions you could make</h1>

<p>Contributions can come in many forms. You can contribute code changes, correct spelling, write documentation, raise issues, conduct testing and more. All forms of contributions are incredibly valuable and appreciated.</p>

<p>As you can see from the above, the preference was for shorter talks. In 2021, we are going to aim to have a mix of two 30 minute slots with a break in the middle (this could be one, one hour talk or two 30 minute talks) and a 30 - 45 minute talk followed by an activity.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-contribute">How To Contribute</h1>

<p>This sections details how to contribute to each of our sites.</p>

<h4 id="check-the-contribution-guidelines-of-the-projects">Check the contribution guidelines of the projects</h4>

<p>Open Source repositories often have contribution guidelines. This is often documented in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contribution.md</code> file, and outlines what behaviours are expected and what to do when contributing to the project.</p>

<h4 id="make-it-clear-on-any-related-issues-that-you-are-picking-up-the-work">Make it clear on any related issues that you are picking up the work</h4>

<p>Check the issues tab on the project to see if the changes you want to make are highlighted in there as a bug, feature or otherwise. Check that no one else has picked up the work and that it is still available to work on. If it is, make a comment that you are picking up the work and mark it as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">in progress</code> with a label.</p>

<h4 id="fork-the-repository">Fork the repository</h4>

<p><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/" target="_blank">Fork the repository</a> and clone it locally. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork" target="_blank">Configure your remote fork to have the original projects main branch as it’s upstream.</a> If you regularly pull in changes from this remote “upstream” repository, your fork will remain up to date, reducing the chance of later complex merge conflicts.</p>

<h4 id="create-a-branch">Create a branch</h4>

<p>In your forked repository create a branch, which is named according to the contribution guidelines for the repository. If there are no guidelines available, give your branch a short name that summarises your changes.</p>

<h4 id="clear-commits">Clear commits</h4>

<p>While working on your changes, make sure to keep commits small and clear. If possible, each commit should be a change which builds and has any tests passing. There are a few advantages to having small, clear commits. One of which is that the owners of the repositories will be able to read through your commits when a PR is raised to see what changes you made, in what order and what your thought processes were.</p>

<h4 id="test-your-changes">Test your changes</h4>

<p>Whether manually or not, test your changes and gather evidence of them working. Run any existing tests as well to ensure the project is still working. Instructions for how to run the projects locally can be found in the repositories README.</p>

<h4 id="be-detailed-when-raising-the-pull-request">Be detailed when raising the Pull Request</h4>

<p>You can raise a Pull Request at the end of your changes, or open a draft pull request early so that others can see your changes as they progress. When filling out the details of the Pull Request, I would advise including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A reference to any issue you are addressing. This is done using a # followed by the number of your issue. For example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#97</code>.</li>
  <li>A short description of the problem you are solving and the benfits of your changes.</li>
  <li>Evidence of your changes working. This can include screen shots from manual tests and instructions for replicating the result locally.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the .NET Notts repositories have templates depicting what information is needed in the Pull Request description section.</p>

<h4 id="double-check-youve-met-the-contribution-guidelines">Double check you’ve met the contribution guidelines</h4>

<p>Go back to the contribution guidelines and check that you’ve met the instructions/requirements outlined in them.</p>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>This short survey has given us a lot of insights into what we can try in the near future with .NET Notts. It’s understood that we won’t be able to fit everyone’s needs, but hopefully this will benefit the majority.</p>

<p>The meetup start times will continue to start at 18.30. From here on out we are going to aim to have two 30 minute slots each meetup and in the future to look at some activities and networking we can introduce every now and then.</p>

<p>Lastly, while keeping the .NET focus, we’ll see if we can get talks in the areas programming, testing, core skills and cloud.</p>
