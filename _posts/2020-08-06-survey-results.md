.NET Notts is having a refresh. For a long time the event has run with two, hour long talks with a break. Back when this was a physical event, people would come after work, have their dinner in the meetup break and head home for the end of the evening.

With peoples schedules changing with the recent pandemic and our recent changes in the meetups organisation, we thought it was a good time to address making some changes.

We wanted these changes to be community lead. To help with this we sent out a questionnaire for our attendees to answer, to let us know what suits their schedules best.

<br/>

## The meetup format

The first question was around the format of the meetup. We offered a range of options from our current longer talks, through to half an hour of talks followed by a networking activity.

As you can see from the above, the preference was for shorter talks. In 2021, we are going to aim to have a mix of two 30 minute slots with a break in the middle (this could be one, one hour talk or two 30 minute talks) and a 30 - 45 minute talk followed by an activity.

## Start time

As the pandemic has lead to peoples routines changing, some want to have dinner or a break before the meetup starts. We want to see if altering the start time would help some attendees.

Based on the results shown above, we will be starting each event at 18.30. Our reasoning is that those who can make 18.00 are more likely to be able to make the later time, but those who can make the later time may struggle with the earlier one. 

<br/>

## Talk Topics

The last question we had were around the topics presented at the meetup. Though all the topics at the event will be focused around .NET there are plenty of themes that can be explored.

Overwhelmingly, the top topic was programming. This covers a whole host of areas including Blazor, C#, F#, VB and MAUI. The meetup will continue to encourage programming focused talks. 

In 2021, we will also try to get talks on Core skills/Soft skills which is the second highest preference. If we can we will try to get this with a .NET edge, such as working in or managing .NET teams.

We'll also make efforts to continue getting talks in the areas of projects and OSS, testing and cloud.s

# Overview

This short survey has given us a lot of insights into what we can try in the near future with .NET Notts. It's understood that we won't be able to fit everyone's needs, but hopefully this will benefit the majority.

The meetup start times will continue to start at 18.30. From here on out we are going to aim to have two 30 minute slots each meetup and in the future to look at some activities and networking we can introduce every now and then. 

Lastly, while keeping the .NET focus, we'll see if we can get talks in the areas programming, testing, core skills and cloud.
