# Event Summary

This was the last event of the year and we chose to celebrate the end of 2020 in style. With a longer than usual intro we had [Adam Jackson](https://twitter.com/adamj89) announce [The .NET Notts Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/challenge/dotnetnotts), a competition by Microsoft espceially for the members of .NET Notts promoting their Microsoft Learn platform. There were some GREAT prizes available for those completing the challenge.

[Claire Smyth](https://twitter.com/ClaireS_MS) also attended to talk about how and why our members should become a Microsoft MVP, and [Andrew Seward](https://twitter.com/MrAndrew) joined us to encourage members to join the [Tech Nottingham Community](https://www.technottingham.com/join).

This intro was then followed by an excellent talk and Q&A lead by [Mads Torgersen](https://twitter.com/MadsTorgersen). The .NET Notts community were brilliant as always, asking question after question. This is a talk we HIGHLY recommend watching.
