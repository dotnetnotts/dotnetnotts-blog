## Building a real-time serverless app in Blazor using AWS

In this session, we will build an interactive dashboard using [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) that reacts in real-time to events that happen in the real world. We will connect the Blazor application through to a serverless backend built in .Net. Rather than requiring a cluster of servers to maintain our WebSocket communications, we will use a managed service called [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and take advantage of it’s WebSockets support. This service introduces a whole new way of thinking about, and architecting, applications that require duplex communication.

The aim was, by the end of the session, attendees would have the knowledge to build highly scalable and resilient real-time applications without having to manage or scale servers.

## Intro to Xamarin and Azure Cognitive Services

You can be faced with a nightmare of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), [Swift](https://www.swift.com/), Objective C, and other options. This means not only learning multiple languages and frameworks but also having to support two different codebases for the same application.

But Xamarin Native and [Xamarin.Forms](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms) offer a powerful, cross-platform development solution for .NET developers looking to target smartphones, tablets, TV’s, computers and IoT devices. In this talk, Luce shares what Xamarin is including Native and Xamarin.Forms for both C# and F#, how to get started creating a simple HelloWorld app from scratch and a more complex example (will involve at least one Azure service including [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/) for facial recognition).

Also some awesome examples of apps written using Xamarin including ones used to save lives! Luce will take examples from xamarin.com/customers as well as show this demo about how Xamarin was used alongside other technologies to aid with Skin Cancer prediction.

This talk included slides, demos, code samples, live coding and the aim was to have the audience walking away feeling like they too can create a mobile app in just a few minutes and carry their work around with them in their pocket or backpack!
