## Software Product Line Engineering

Instead of implementing a product line, many companies create multiple, disparate products that result in overly-complex management, more bugs, and more difficult maintenance. However, most companies can benefit from creating a software product line, since its benefits result in faster time to market, lower maintenance, fewer bugs, and more manageable complexity. Much like product lines in manufacturing, product lines in software start with a platform of shared, reusable assets and model multiple but distinct products through strategic reuse and variation of features. In this session, you'll learn the basics of product line engineering as a discipline so you can achieve the ultimate form of engineered reusability in software through product lines.
