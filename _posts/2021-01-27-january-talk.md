# Event Summary

For the first talk of 2021, we were delighted to host Rachel Appel, who talked up through Software Product Line Engineering and how this had been applied at JetBrains.

This talk gave a detailed view of the evolution of JetBrains products and how they are now built and organised. It also walked through what was involved in getting to where they are today.

## Software Product Line Engineering

Instead of implementing a product line, many companies create multiple, disparate products that result in overly-complex management, more bugs, and more difficult maintenance. However, most companies can benefit from creating a software product line, since its benefits result in faster time to market, lower maintenance, fewer bugs, and more manageable complexity. Much like product lines in manufacturing, product lines in software start with a platform of shared, reusable assets and model multiple but distinct products through strategic reuse and variation of features. In this session, you'll learn the basics of product line engineering as a discipline so you can achieve the ultimate form of engineered reusability in software through product lines.
