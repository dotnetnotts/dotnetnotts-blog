## About Maira Wenzel

Maira Wenzel is a Program Manager on the .NET team, working on the dot.net website.

## The Architecture of the .NET Website

Let's explore the architecture and the implementation of the https://dot.net website, including some of its latest features such as the .NET Live TV, which uses Blazor WebAssembly.

We'll go over some of the things we've done in the past year since I joined the team, lessons learned from some live site incidents, and future plans for the site.
